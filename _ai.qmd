\subsection{Significance of Investigation and Anticipated Impact}

Research into the space plasma environment through spacecraft investigations has revealed that the solar wind magnetic field, in general, adheres to Parker's model of the heliospheric current sheet. However, localized transient currents can deviate from these norms, often being much more intense than standard model currents. These aberrations occur due to the existence of various discontinuities, reflected as notable variations in magnetic field components \citep[see][]{Colburn&Sonett66, Burlaga68, Turner&Siscoe71}. Typically, these fluctuations present as rotations within the magnetic field within the plane of the two most fluctuating components.

As illustrated in Figure ~\ref{fig1}, these rotations are observed at a multitude of radial distances from the Sun. These discontinuities are crucial to the process of energy dissipation \citep[or particle acceleration in the solar wind, refer to][]{Dmitruk04, MacBride08, Osman12:solarwind, Tessein13}. Furthermore, their significant contribution to magnetic fluctuation spectra \citep{Borovsky10:solarwind, Zhdankin12, Lion16} implies potential impacts on space weather \citep[as reviewed by][]{Tsurutani11:jastp}. 

Nonetheless, past assessments of solar wind discontinuities in deep space have seldom been coordinated with concurrent measures of solar wind closer to the Sun. This failing in coordination inhibits the complete understanding of both the structure and dynamic behavior of these discontinuities. The magnetic field measurements taken by the Juno spacecraft over a period of six years (2011-2016) and the magnetic field and plasma measurements taken by the PSP over four years (2019-2023), used in combination with the STEREO, WIND, and ARTEMIS magnetic field and plasma monitor at $1$ AU during the operation of Juno and PSP, provide an invaluable dataset for the examination of discontinuity characteristics in both the inner and outer heliosphere.

        \caption{Distribution of occurrence rate of solar wind discontinuities \citep[see][]{Soding01}.}
        \label{fig1}
\end{wrapfigure}

Various heliospheric spacecraft missions have yielded statistical data on the characteristics and potential origins of these solar wind discontinuities. For instance, observations from Helios-1 and -2 have detected an abundance of these discontinuities within the Earth's orbit (less than $1$AU away from the Sun) \citep{Mariani83}. Similarly, the Ulysses mission identified discontinuities between $1$ and $5$AU \cite{Tsurutani97}, while Voyager 1's findings at $39-43$AU \citep{Burlaga96,Burlaga11} suggested that these discontinuities pervade the entire heliosphere. 

Combining measurements from Voyager, Ulysses, WIND, and Helios-2, it is possible to reconstruct the radial variation in these discontinuities' occurrence rates (as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig1} and detailed in \citep{Soding01}). However, these measurements were taken at different times, leading to varying radial distances. 

Utilizing concurrent measurements from Juno, STEREO, WIND, ARTEMIS, and PSP, it is anticipated that this research will investigate and quantify the properties of solar wind discontinuities at different distances from the Sun—both within $1AU$ and up to $5$AU.

The data obtained from Ulysses' high-latitude solar wind measurements (from $1-5$ AU) has shown that most discontinuities occur within stream-stream interaction regions and/or within Alfvén wave trains \citep{Tsurutani95, Tsurutani&Ho99}. These discontinuities can be primarily attributed to the non-linear evolution of Alfvén waves, often referred to as wave steepening. Key influencing factors in the non-linear evolution of Alfvén wave include background plasma/magnetic field inconsistencies and varying dissipation processes \citep{Lerche75, Prakash&Diamond99, Medvedev97:prl, Nariyuki14, Yang15}. Both hybrid simulations \citep[see][]{Vasquez&Hollweg98, Vasquez&Hollweg01, TenBarge&Howes13} and analytical models \citep[e.g.,][]{Kennel88:jetp, Hada89, Malkov91, Wu&Kennel92, Medvedev97:pop} have proven that this steepening results in the formation of discontinuities in configurations akin to near-Earth observations. However, the efficiency of these processes in an empirically expanding solar wind hasn't been thoroughly observed. The context provided by regular and prolonged observations by Juno and PSP, coupled with near-permanent near-Earth solar wind monitoring, presents an opportunity to evaluate discontinuity occurrence rates over an unparalleled large radial distance range ($\sim 0.1$ AU -- $\sim 45$AU). In this paper, we aim to analyze the occurrence rates of discontinuity at varying radial distances, comparing these rates with the prediction of the adiabatic expansion model in an effort to elucidate whether the generation or deterioration of discontinuity heavily influences discontinuity statistics significantly distanced from the solar wind acceleration region.

\subsection{Research Aims and Methodology}
The main objective of this research is the examination of how solar wind discontinuities evolve with radial distance. The methodology involves the collection and analysis of two datasets: one that combines $1$AU solar wind measurements conducted by STEREO, ARTEMIS, and WIND, alongside Juno spacecraft measurements during its voyage from $1$AU to $5$AU. The second dataset merges data from the same missions at $1$AU and includes information from the PSP within the inner heliosphere. This methodology will enable us to explore the three following research objectives:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The evolvement of discontinuity occurrence rates with radial distance beyond $1$ AU
  \item The evolvement of discontinuity occurrence rates within $1$ AU 
  \item The evolution of discontinuity properties, such as magnetic field magnitude, current density, spatial scale, etc., as the solar wind propagates from regions close to the Sun to 1AU, extending to 5AU 
\end{itemize} 

The following sections will provide a brief overview of the preliminary findings of this research and key elements of the methodology applied.

\subsection{Overview of Research Approaches}

\subsubsection{Dataset, spacecraft instruments, and solar wind model}\label{dataset-spacecraft-instruments-and-solar-wind-model}

For this research, datasets from five separate missions, all measuring solar wind magnetic field and plasma, will be utilized. The collaborative observations from these missions are expected to enhance our understanding of solar wind discontinuities, giving insights into their radial distribution and evolvement \citep{velli2020}.

\begin{SCfigure}

\caption{A comparison, depicted as a time-series graph, of MSWIM2D (red) and Juno-observed solar
wind magnetic field magnitudes}\label{fig:model}
\end{SCfigure}

\paragraph{Juno}\label{juno}

From Juno, we will be utilizing the following data: magnetic fields with a $\sim 1$s resolution measured by the Juno Fluxgate Magnetometer (MAG) \citep{connerney2017}, the ion bulk velocity \(v\), and the plasma density \(n\) at an hourly resolution from the solar wind model.

\paragraph{Parker Solar Probe (PSP)}\label{parker-solar-probe-psp}

From the PSP, we will be incorporating the following data into our research: magnetic fields measured by the FIELDS experiment \citep{bale2016}, in addition to the ion bulk velocity \(v\), and the plasma

## Polish private_upload/default_user/2024-01-21-19-57-03/main.tex.part-4.tex

The density (\(n\)) data featuring an hourly resolution is obtained from the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) Investigation \citep{kasper2016}.

\paragraph{ARTEMIS}\label{artemis}

Data compiled by ARTEMIS consists of the following: a fluxgate magnetometer with approximately a fifth of a second resolution for recording magnetic fields \citep{auster2008}, along with data on the ion bulk velocity (\(v\)) and plasma density (\(n\)). The latter two parameters are derived from the velocity distribution acquired via the Electrostatic Analyzer, which operates with around 4 seconds resolution \citep{mcfadden2009}.

\paragraph{STEREO}\label{stereo}

Data amassed by STEREO comprises magnetic field measurements obtained through the magnetic field experiment, with an approximate resolution of 1/8 seconds \citep{acuña2008}. Additionally, in-situ measurements of particles and CME transients (IMPACT) are undertaken \citep{luhmann2008}. Information on the ion bulk velocity (\(v\)) as well as the plasma density (\(n\))—characterized by an hourly resolution—are gathered by the Plasma and Suprathermal Ion Composition (PLASTIC) tool \citep{galvin2008}.

\paragraph{WIND}\label{wind}

The Wind mission contributes data that includes readings of magnetic fields at roughly 1/11 second resolution, as captured by the Magnetic Field Investigation (MFI) \citep{lepping1995}, along with information on the ion bulk velocity (\(v\)) and the plasma density (\(n\)). These variables are systematized with an hourly resolution by leveraging the Solar Wind Experiment (SWE) \citep{ogilvie1995}.

\paragraph{Solar wind model}\label{solar-wind-model}

June measurements exclude plasma characteristics, provoking a reliance on the solar wind speed model to estimate the spatial scale of discontinuities (thicknesses). The Two-Dimensional Outer Heliosphere Solar Wind Modeling (MSWIM2D) \citep{keebler2022} supplies hourly data for the solar wind model, facilitating the ascertainment of the ion bulk velocity (\(v\)) and plasma density (\(n\)) at the Juno mission's location. The model—a product of the BATSRUS MHD solver—is proficient in simulating solar wind propagation from an extent of 1 to 75 astronomical units (AU) within the ecliptic plane. This range is inclusive of our primary area of interest. Figure \ref{fig:model} specifies the comparative magnitudes of the magnetic field as determined from MSWIM2D and measured by Juno.

\subsubsection{Determination of discontinuities}\label{determination-of-discontinuities}

The method propounded by \citep{liu2022a} will be engaged to identify discontinuities in the solar wind. This methodology exhibits superior compatibility with minor field changes and is more resilient to scenarios prevalent in the outer heliosphere. For each time stamp \(t\), the intervals are defined as follows: the preliminary interval is given by \([-1,-1/2]\cdot T+t\), the central interval by \([-1/2,1/2]\cdot T+t\), and the subsequent interval by \([1/2,1]\cdot T+t\). The intervals signify time lags represented by \(T\). The corresponding series of magnetic field data within these timeframes are denoted as \( {\bf B}_- \), \( {\bf B}_0 \), and \( {\bf B}_+ \) respectively. For a discontinuity to be ascertained, three conditions must be jointly fulfilled: (1)\( \sigma({\bf B}_0)>2\max\left(\sigma({\bf B}_-, \sigma({\bf B}_+)\right)\), (2) \( \sigma\left({\bf B}_-+{\bf B}_+\right)>\sigma({\bf B}_-)+\sigma({\bf B}_+)\), and (3) \( |\Delta {\bf B}|>|{\bf B}_{bf}|/10\). Here, \(\sigma\) and \( {\bf B}_{bg} \) denote the standard deviation and the magnitude of the backdrop magnetic field respectively, with \( \Delta {\bf B}={\bf B}(t+T/2)-{\bf B}(t-T/2) \). The initial two conditions safeguard the identified discontinuity field changes as being sizeable enough to stand out from arbitrary fluctuations in magnetic fields. The third condition serves as a complementary precaution to minimize recognition uncertainty. We will also resort to the Maximum Variance (MVA) analysis \citep{Sonnerup68} for discerning the primary (most variable) magnetic field component (\(B_l\)) and the medium-variation component (\(B_m\)). Figure \ref{fig:examples} manifests several instances of solar wind discontinuities detected by different spacecraft.

\end{SCfigure}

\subsubsection{Rate of Discontinuity Occurrence}\label{discontinuities-occurrence-rate}

At the core of this proposal is an approach that utilizes solar wind measurements taken at 1AU (STEREO, ARTEMIS, WIND) and contrasts these with readings from Juno and PSP. This comparison will assist in distinguishing the effects of temporal variations in the solar wind, and spatial variations in the discontinuity occurrence rate and characteristics as dependent on radial distance from the Sun. An example of such a comparison regarding occurrence rate is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:rate}. In this figure, the number of discontinuities detected daily by various spacecraft missions is plotted (employing the same temporal resolution for magnetic field data and identical criteria for determining discontinuities). The radial distance of Juno from 2011-2015 can be observed in Fig. \ref{fig:model}. The quantity of discontinuities detected daily by Juno aligns with the numbers recorded by STEREO, WIND, and ARTEMIS when Juno is approximately $1$AU from the Sun. This rate of occurrence diminishes with increasing distance (or with time after $\sim 2013$) as Juno travels from $1$AU to $5$AU. This type of comparison will likewise be applied to analyze the discontinuity characteristics and occurrence rates derived for PSP and Juno.

\begin{SCfigure}

        \caption{The discontinuity rate measured by Juno aligns with the readings from STEREO, WIND, and ARTEMIS when Juno is approximately $1$AU distant. This rate declines with increasing distance (or time after $\sim 2013$) as Juno transitions from routing at $1$AU to $5$AU. These comparative methodologies will be similarly applied to probe discontinuity characteristics and to calculate occurrence rates deduced for PSP and Juno. The radial journey of Juno from 2011-2015 is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:model}.}

\subsection{Relevance to NASA's Heliophysics Overarching Goals}
This project is centered on the inquiry into solar wind discontinuities. As a crucial component of magnetic field turbulence and the principal interface of charged particle acceleration, this project contributes to NASA's overarching objective in Heliophysics to: {\it "Explore and characterize the physical processes occurring in the space environment from the Sun to the Heliopause and throughout the universe"} and its specific objective: {\it "Analyze the physical processes transpiring in the space environment from the Sun to Earth and across the solar system."}.

\subsection{Project Timeline}
This project, spanning three years, assigns each year to a pre-determined objective: in the {\bf first year}, the focus will be on compiling and analyzing Juno's observations of solar wind discontinuities, supported by a solar wind model and supplemental observations from $1$AU missions (STEREO, ARTEMIS, WIND); in the {\bf second year}, a similar analysis of solar wind discontinuities will be conducted for PSP, using additional data from the $1$AU missions. In the {\bf third year}, particular discontinuity characteristics, such as spatial scales and current density, will be analyzed for both datasets. The radial evolution of these features will be compared to the expectations forecasted by solar wind adiabatic expansion.

\section{Mentoring Plan or Agreement}
"Zijin Zhang, a second-year Ph.D. student, is mentored by Professor Angelopoulos (PI) in the intellectually stimulating and supportive environment of the Experimental Space Physics group, which includes Dr. Chen Shi and Dr. Anton Artemyev. Mr. Zhang is preparing to schedule his departmental oral examination, during which he will define his thesis topic based on the subject proposal. He has showcased his independent research abilities and creativity through presentations at various international scientific meetings. The Mentoring Plan for Mr. Zhang includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
Weekly individual meetings with Prof. Angelopoulos (PI), Dr. Chen, and Dr. Artemyev. These meetings focus predominantly on resolving issues concerning the execution of the research plan, reviewing progress and working towards the defined goals.
\item
Weekly updates during group meetings, which serve as a platform for rapid exchange of views with other team members (several experts on solar wind discontinuity) about latest research findings.
\item
Focused discussions with local experts on the observational and theoretical aspects of the project (Prof. Velli: PSP dataset). These one-on-one sessions aim to provide additional training to Mr. Zhang, refining his data analysis and theoretical approach skills crucial for the successful execution of the project.
\end{itemize}

These research meetings, combined with presentations during joint inter-departmental space physics presentations, Journal Club, and weekly seminars, constitute Mr. Zhang's primary research-related daily interactions within UCLA's setting. Besides, Prof. Angelopoulos will encourage Mr. Zhang to attend specialized courses quarterly that facilitate an in-depth understanding of essentials like non-linear MHD and kinetic theory, turbulence, kinetic simulations, and instrumentation. In summary, Mr. Zhang will be exposed to a blend of formal and informal education through a well-rounded and diverse set of courses, meetings, and seminars at UCLA.

Both the PI and FI are committed to the successful completion of the proposed research plan.

Also, the FI will be encouraged to attend meetings at AGU, GEM, and other conferences to gain insights from other instructors and to network with students and early-career scientists from various locations. With substantial computer resources and software support (such as SPEDAS; \citep{Angelopoulos19}), and assistance from local programming staff as well as from instrument teams on the ARTEMIS mission (where Prof. Angelopoulos is an active member), Mr. Zhang will be able to address any questions encountered during his research successfully, using the missions' respective datasets.

Given the supportive research environment, the advisor's commitment, and the advisor's track record of successfully guiding 13 PhD recipients to date, Mr. Zhang is expected to have a rich, varied, and productive research experience."
