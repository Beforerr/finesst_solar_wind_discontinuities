# Background

Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) is a program element in Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES).

Heliophysics Research Program key objectives are:

-   Explore and characterize the physical processes in the space environment from the Sun to the heliopause and throughout the universe
-   Advance our understanding of the Sun’s activity, and the connections between solar variability and Earth and planetary space environments, the outer reaches of our solar system, and the interstellar medium
-   Develop the knowledge and capability to detect and predict extreme conditions in space to protect life and society and to safeguard human and robotic explorers beyond Earth

# Scientific/Technical/Management

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
This section describes the proposed research project and should be self-contained without relying on other sections of the proposal, such as the Research Readiness Statement or Budget Narrative. Proposers may include figures and tables as appropriate. This section, excluding citations, may total no more than six (6) pages conforming to formatting requirements detailed above. The S/T/M Section should include the following elements:

-   A well-defined problem with a justification of its scientific significance and a detailed approach for its resolution.
-   A statement describing the relevance of the proposed work to the appropriate SMD Division and a program within that division. If the research is relevant to more than one division/program, please identify the other division(s).
-   A description of the approach to be taken to address the chosen problem. A period of performance for the proposed project describing anticipated accomplishments and major milestones, including planned publications. In cases when the PI already has an ongoing research award from NASA, the research proposed under FINESST may address a similar topic, but the proposal should make clear how the proposed research goes beyond what NASA has already funded or selected for funding.

### Model validation

<!-- ![PSP orbits](https://blogs.nasa.gov/parkersolarprobe/wp-content/uploads/sites/274/2021/01/Parker-Orbit7Geometry-scaled.jpg) -->

We are using [Michigan Solar WInd Model 2D (MSWIM2D)](http://csem.engin.umich.edu/MSWIM2D/), which models the solar wind propagation in 2D using the BATSRUS MHD solver. [@keebler2022]
