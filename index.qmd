::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
This section describes the proposed research project and should be self-contained without relying on other sections of the proposal, such as the Research Readiness Statement or Budget Narrative. Proposers may include figures and tables as appropriate. This section, excluding citations, may total no more than six (6) pages conforming to formatting requirements detailed above. The S/T/M Section should include the following elements:

-   A well-defined problem with a justification of its scientific significance and a detailed approach for its resolution.
-   A statement describing the relevance of the proposed work to the appropriate SMD Division and a program within that division. If the research is relevant to more than one division/program, please identify the other division(s).
-   A description of the approach to be taken to address the chosen problem. A period of performance for the proposed project describing anticipated accomplishments and major milestones, including planned publications. In cases when the PI already has an ongoing research award from NASA, the research proposed under FINESST may address a similar topic, but the proposal should make clear how the proposed research goes beyond what NASA has already funded or selected for funding.

### Model validation

<!-- ![PSP orbits](https://blogs.nasa.gov/parkersolarprobe/wp-content/uploads/sites/274/2021/01/Parker-Orbit7Geometry-scaled.jpg) -->

We are using [Michigan Solar WInd Model 2D (MSWIM2D)](http://csem.engin.umich.edu/MSWIM2D/), which models the solar wind propagation in 2D using the BATSRUS MHD solver. [@keebler2022]

## Relevance to Heliophysics Overarching Goals

This project focuses on investigation of the solar wind discontinuities, the key element of magnetic field turbulence and the primary interface of charged particle acceleration. Thus, the project contributes to NASA Heliophysics' overarching goal to: *"Explore and characterize the physical processes in the space environment from the Sun to the heliopause and throughout the universe”* and its specific objectives to: *"Explore the physical processes at work in the space environment from the Sun to Earth and throughout the solar system"*.


## Project Schedule

In this three-year project, each year is devoted to a stated project objective: in the **first year** we will focus on collection and analysis of Juno observations of solar wind discontinuities, supplemented by the solar wind model and observations of $1$AU missions (STEREO, ARTEMIS, WIND); in the **second year** the same analysis of solar wind discontinuities with performed for PSP, with the supplementary dataset from $1$AU missions. In the **third year** we will analyze specific discontinuity characteristics (spatial scales, current density, etc.) for two datasets and compare radial evolution of these characteristics with predictions of expectations from solar wind adiabatic expansion.

#### Management

of this project is fully performed by **FI**, Zijin Zhang, who will also be responsible for the assembly and analysis of the observational dataset, and generation of a combined Juno/solar wind model dataset. Project **PI**, Prof. Vassilis Angelopoulos, and group members Dr. Anton Artemyev and Dr. Chen Shi, will contribute to discussions and the education and training of Zijin Zhang. Expertise of Prof. V. Angelopoulos in spacecraft measurement techniques and data analysis \cite{Angelopoulos19,Angelopoulos11:ARTEMIS}, Dr. A. Artemyev in solar wind discontinuity observation and modeling \citep{Artemyev18:apj,Artemyev19:jgr:solarwind}, and Dr. Chen Shi in solar wind observations and simulations \citep{ChenShi21:a&a,ChenShi22:apj,ChenShi23:apj} guarantees that Z. Zhang will receive all necessary mentorship, advice and support, and thus will successfully complete the thesis project.
