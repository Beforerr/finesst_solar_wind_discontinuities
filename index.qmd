# Background

Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) is a program element in Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES).

Heliophysics Research Program key objectives are:

-   Explore and characterize the physical processes in the space environment from the Sun to the heliopause and throughout the universe
-   Advance our understanding of the Sun’s activity, and the connections between solar variability and Earth and planetary space environments, the outer reaches of our solar system, and the interstellar medium
-   Develop the knowledge and capability to detect and predict extreme conditions in space to protect life and society and to safeguard human and robotic explorers beyond Earth

(a) The magnetic field magnitude and three components in Radial‐Tangential‐Normal (RTN) coordinate system, (b) the magnetic field in local magnetic normal (LMN) coordinate system, (c and d) the proton velocity in RTN and LMN coordinate systems, (e) the proton density, (f) the proton thermal pressure, the magnetic pressure and the sum, (g) the tangential components of the electric field in LMN coordinate system in the RD rest frame, (h) the position, orientation, and motion of the RD, (i–k) the distributions of BL, JM, and J · E across the RD, (l and m) the jump conditions across the RD. In (h), the cyan plane and arrow represent the RD and its motion vector, and the yellow curve shows the PSP orbit. In (j), both the colors and the curve correspond to the values of JM, and two vertical dashed lines indicate the area of |JM|>13max|JM| $\\vert {J}_{M}\\vert > \\frac{1}{3}\\text{max}\\left(\\vert {J}_{M}\\vert \\right)$ whose width is defined as the half thickness of the discontinuity. In (m), the solid lines present the actual upstream and downstream velocities, while the dashed lines show the theoretical downstream velocity to satisfy the Walén relation."}
