This project aims to develop two key outputs: a data product focusing on the statistics of solar wind discontinuities and a suite of modeling software for analyzing these phenomena.

## Data Products: Statistics of Solar Wind Discontinuities

#### Product Description:

We will generate comprehensive statistics derived from in-situ satellite measurements. This includes:

a. Event lists in ASCII format.
b. Parameters of solar wind discontinuities from two datasets: Juno observations (2011-2015) combined with $1$AU observations, and PSP observations combined with $1$AU observations.
c. Visual aids such as figures in PNG format and detailed tables in ASCII format, providing insights into solar wind velocity and density as reconstructed for the Juno location.

#### Scientific Significance:

This dataset will facilitate the first quantification of the evolution of solar wind discontinuity with radial distance.

#### Data Types and Volume:

The project will produce ASCII tables and figure files, estimated to be less than 10 GB in total.

#### Documentation and Delivery:

Comprehensive documentation, including selection criteria for solar wind discontinuities and spacecraft measurement details, will be provided. The expected delivery time is in the third year of the project.

#### Archiving Method:

The data products will be published as supporting information in academic papers focused on solar wind discontinuity characteristics at various radial distances. Additionally, the dataset will be uploaded to the open archive [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).

## Software: Modular and Scalable Solutions for Solar Wind Analysis

#### Software Overview
We are in the process of developing a set of routines that are both modular and scalable, tailored specifically for in-depth solar wind analysis and the identification of discontinuities. These routines, accessible in Python and Interactive Data Language (IDL), are designed with a focus on performance efficiency and adaptability, enabling the analysis of data from diverse space missions. The initial Python library is available at our [project website](https://beforerr.github.io/ids_finder).

#### Scientific Significance:

These advanced routines will not only facilitate detailed analysis of solar wind discontinuities and their radial evolution but also provide a comprehensive toolset for the broader scientific community to study magnetic field data from various space missions.


#### Modular and Scalable Design: 

The software's modular architecture allows for easy adaptation and extension, making it suitable for analyzing data beyond the initial scope of this project. Its scalable nature ensures efficient performance, even when dealing with large datasets from different missions.

#### Data Types and Volume:

The software package will consist of IDL and Python files, collectively amounting to less than 10 MB.

#### Documentation and Release:

We will provide comprehensive documentation, including detailed descriptions of each module, usage guidelines, and examples. This documentation will assist users in customizing the software for their specific needs. The software is expected to be released in the first year of the project.

#### Archiving Method:

Python function will be integrated into the open-source Python-based Space Physics Environment Data Analysis System (PySPEDAS), while IDL routines will be added to the SPEDAS framework \cite{Angelopoulos19}. Both will be available under MIT license terms and also uploaded to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).

## Roles and responsibilities of team members for data management

The Project FI, with the guidance of the PI, will be responsible for releasing and archiving all datasets produced within this project.


## Publication of results

We anticipate producing 2-3 peer-reviewed manuscripts for journals such as J. Geophys. Res. and Geophys. Res. Lett. Each manuscript will include a supplementary dataset (as detailed in Section 1) to facilitate result reproduction. Project funds will be utilized to ensure open access publication of these papers.
