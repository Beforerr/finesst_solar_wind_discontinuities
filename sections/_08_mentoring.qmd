Zijin Zhang is a 2nd year PhD student mentored by Prof. Angelopoulos (PI), and in the supportive and intellectually dynamic environment of the Experimental Space Physics group that includes Dr. Chen Shi and and Dr. Anton Artemyev. He is about to schedule his department oral exam, defining his thesis topic on the subject proposal. He has demonstrated independent research capabilities and creative work through the presentations in several international science meetings. The Mentoring Plan for Mr. Zhang includes:


- Weekly individual (splinter) meetings with Prof. Angelopoulos (PI), Dr. Chen and Dr. Artemyev. These are mostly to operationally resolve issues of the research plan realization and review the progress and work towards the stated goals. 
- Weekly updated in group meetings, that serve for quick opinion exchange with other team members (several experts on solar wind discontinuity) on hot-off-the-press results.
- Splinter discussions with local experts on the observational and theoretical aspects of the project (Prof. Velli: PSP dataset). These one-on-one meetings aim to provide additional training for Mr. Zhang in data analysis techniques and theoretical approaches useful for project realization. 

These research meetings plus presentations in joint inter-departmental (encompassing AOS, P\&A and EPSS department members) space physics student presentations, Journal Club, and weekly seminars form Mr. Zhang's primary research-related day-to-day interactions in the UCLA environment. In addition, Prof. Angelopoulos will encourage Mr. Zhang to attend (at a low rate of 1 per quarter) specialized courses that facilitate in-depth exposure to fundamentals, such as non-linear MHD and kinetic theory, turbulence, kinetic simulations, and instrumentation. In all, Mr. Zhang will be exposed to a combination of formal and informal education through a robust and diverse set of courses, meetings, and seminars at UCLA.

The PI and the FI are committed to the completion of the proposed research plan.

The FI will also be encouraged to attend meetings at AGU, GEM, and other meetings in order to be exposed to experiences from other instructors, and to network with students and early career scientists at those locations.
With significant computer resources and software (such as SPEDAS; \citep{Angelopoulos19}) support from local programming staff, as well as from instrument teams on the ARTEMIS mission (in which Prof. Angelopoulos is an active member), Mr. Zhang will be able to address successfully any questions encountered during his research using the missions’ respective datasets.

The above research environment and the advisor’s commitment and recent heritage in successfully advising 13 PhD recipients thus far warrant a rich, diverse and productive research experience for Mr. Zhang.
