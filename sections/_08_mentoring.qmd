Zijin Zhang is a second-year PhD student under the mentorship of Prof. Angelopoulos in the stimulating and intellectually vibrant environment of the Experimental Space Physics group. This group includes notable scholars such as Dr. Anton Artemyev and Dr. Chen Shi. Zhang is preparing to schedule his departmental oral exam, a significant step in defining his thesis topic. He has already showcased his independent research skills and creativity through presentations at several international scientific meetings.

The mentoring plan for Mr. Zhang is comprehensive and includes:

- Regular one-on-one meetings with Prof. Angelopoulos, Dr. Chen, and Dr. Artemyev. These sessions focus on the operational aspects of his research plan, progress reviews, and goal alignment.

- Weekly updates in group meetings, which foster rapid exchange of ideas and feedback on the latest results with other experts specializing in solar wind discontinuity.

- Targeted discussions with local experts on both observational and theoretical facets of his project, like those with Prof. Velli regarding the PSP dataset. These personalized sessions are designed to enhance Mr. Zhang's skills in data analysis and theoretical methodologies essential for his research.

Additionally, Mr. Zhang's engagement in the UCLA academic milieu includes participating in inter-departmental space physics student presentations, Journal Club, and weekly seminars. These interactions, integral to his day-to-day academic life, are complemented by Prof. Angelopoulos's encouragement to attend specialized courses. These courses, taken at a manageable pace of one per quarter, cover essential topics such as non-linear MHD, kinetic theory, turbulence, kinetic simulations, and instrumentation.

The proposed plan ensures that Mr. Zhang will benefit from a blend of formal education and practical experience, supported by a diverse array of courses, meetings, and seminars at UCLA.

Prof. Angelopoulos, along with the Faculty Investigator (FI), is dedicated to the successful completion of the proposed research. Mr. Zhang will also be encouraged to participate in conferences like AGU and GEM, broadening his exposure to different instructional styles and networking opportunities with peers and early career scientists.

With substantial computational resources and software support (e.g., SPEDAS; [@Angelopoulos19; @grimesSpacePhysicsEnvironment2022]) from the local programming staff and ARTEMIS mission teams—where Prof. Angelopoulos plays an active role—Mr. Zhang is well-equipped to tackle any research challenges using the missions' datasets.

Overall, the nurturing research environment and Prof. Angelopoulos's proven track record of successfully mentoring 13 PhD recipients to date ensure a rich, diverse, and productive research experience for Mr. Zhang.
