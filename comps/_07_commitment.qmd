# Statements of Commitment and Letters of Resource Support

<!-- # Statements of Commitment and Letters of Support, Feasibility and Endorsement -->

Do not add Statements of Commitment from any team member listed under Section VI of the NSPIRES cover page and who acknowledges commitment via NSPIRES. For example, when a collaborator or Co-I directly confirms their participation via NSPIRES, that is sufficient commitment. If the proposing team has regular access to a facility or resource, then no letter of Resource support is needed. See Section 2.17 in the 2023 NASA Proposer's Guide for how to prepare "Letters of Resource Support'' to demonstrate that a facility or resource is available for the proposed use. Statements of commitment are only required when commitment cannot be made via NSPIRES, such as when a proposer is using Grants.gov.
