### Dataset, spacecraft instruments, and solar wind model
```

Synergistic observations [@velli2020] advance our understanding of the solar wind.

#### Juno

We use the following data collected by Juno: magnetic ﬁelds with a ∼1s resolution by the Juno Fluxgate Magnetometer (MAG) [@connerney2017], the ion bulk velocity $v$, and the plasma density $n$ with a hourly resolution from solar wind model (see below).

#### Parker Solar Probe (PSP)

We use the following data collected by PSP: magnetic ﬁelds by the FIELDS experiment [@bale2016], the ion bulk velocity $v$, and the plasma density $n$ with a hourly resolution by the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) Investigation [@kasper2016].

#### ARTEMIS

We use the following data collected by ARTEMIS: magnetic ﬁelds with a ∼1s resolution by the Fluxgate Magnetometer [@auster2008], the ion bulk velocity $v$, and the plasma density $n$ calculated from velocity distribution by the Electrostatic Analyzer [@mcfadden2009].

#### STEREO

We use the following data collected by STEREO: magnetic ﬁelds with a ∼1/8 s resolution by the magnetic ﬁeld experiment [@acuña2008] on In-situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients (IMPACT) [@luhmann2008], the ion bulk velocity $v$, and the plasma density $n$ with a hourly resolution by the Plasma and Suprathermal Ion Composition (PLASTIC) [@galvin2008].

#### Wind

We use the following data collected by Wind: magnetic ﬁelds with a ∼1/11 s resolution by the Magnetic Field Investigation (MFI) [@lepping1995], the ion bulk velocity $v$, and the plasma density $n$ with a hourly resolution by the Solar Wind Experiment (SWE) [@ogilvie1995].

#### Solar wind model

The hourly solar wind model data from the Two-Dimensional Outer Heliosphere Solar Wind Modeling (MSWIM2D) [@keebler2022] were employed to determine the ion bulk velocity $v$ and plasma density $n$ at the location of the Juno mission. Utilizing the BATSRUS MHD solver, this model is capable of simulating the propagation of the solar wind from 1 to 75 astronomical units (AU) in the ecliptic plane, effectively encompassing the region of interest for our study.

### Determination of discontinuities

We use [@liu2022a] method to identify IDs, which has better compatibility for the IDs with minor field changes, and is more robust to the situtaion encountered in the outer heliosphere.

In Liu's method : The first two conditions guarantee that the field changes of the IDs identiﬁed are large enough to be distinguished from the stochastic fluctuations on magnetic fields, while the third is a supplementary condition to reduce the uncertainty of recognition.
